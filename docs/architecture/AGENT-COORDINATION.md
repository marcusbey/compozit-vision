## Communication Protocols

### Daily Coordination Checkpoints
**Time**: 9:00 AM EST
**Duration**: 15 minutes
**Format**: Asynchronous status update

#### Status Update Template
```markdown
## Agent [Number] - [Date]
**Current Task**: [What you're working on]
**Progress**: [Percentage complete]
**Blockers**: [Any dependencies or issues]
**Next**: [Next task to work on]
**Interfaces Published**: [New interfaces available for other agents]
**Dependencies Needed**: [What you need from other agents]
```

### Interface Documentation Standard
When publishing interfaces for other agents:

```typescript
// File: mobile/src/services/ai/interfaces.ts
// Agent 1 (Core) publishes this for other agents

/**
 * AI Processing Interface
 * Published by: Agent 1 (Core)
 * Last Updated: [Date]
 * Dependencies: None
 */
export interface IAIProcessingService {
  processImage(image: ImageData, options: ProcessingOptions): Promise<ProcessedImage>;
  generateDesign(image: ProcessedImage, style: StyleReference): Promise<DesignResult>;
  applyCustomPrompt(design: DesignResult, prompt: string): Promise<DesignResult>;
}

/**
 * Usage Notes for Other Agents:
 * - Agent 2 (Style): Use generateDesign() after style selection
 * - Agent 4 (Prompt): Use applyCustomPrompt() for custom modifications
 * - All processing is async - handle loading states
 */
```

### Conflict Resolution Process

#### Type 1: File Conflicts
1. **Detection**: Automated in merge process
2. **Resolution**: 
   - Check ownership matrix
   - Owner agent has final say
   - Non-owner agent must adapt

#### Type 2: Interface Conflicts
1. **Detection**: Manual during integration
2. **Resolution**:
   - Integration Manager mediates
   - Create adapter layer if needed
   - Document breaking changes

#### Type 3: Dependency Conflicts
1. **Detection**: During dependency requests
2. **Resolution**:
   - Check coordination timeline
   - Adjust task priorities
   - Create temporary stubs if needed

## Risk Mitigation Strategies

### High-Risk Scenarios

#### 1. Agent Falling Behind Schedule
**Risk**: Other agents blocked by dependencies
**Mitigation**:
- Daily progress tracking
- Early warning system (48h behind = alert)
- Backup agent assignment
- Stub implementation for critical interfaces

#### 2. Major Interface Changes
**Risk**: Breaking changes affect multiple agents
**Mitigation**:
- Version interface contracts
- Deprecation notices (48h minimum)
- Adapter patterns for compatibility
- Rollback procedures

#### 3. Integration Conflicts
**Risk**: Features don't work together smoothly
**Mitigation**:
- Early integration testing
- Shared interface definitions
- Regular cross-agent communication
- Integration rehearsals

#### 4. Performance Bottlenecks
**Risk**: Combined features cause performance issues
**Mitigation**:
- Continuous performance monitoring
- Resource usage budgets per agent
- Early performance testing
- Optimization sprints
