# Product Requirements Document: Dynamic Context-Aware Icon System

## Overview

This PRD outlines a dynamic, context-aware icon system for the mobile application's main creation screen. The system intelligently displays relevant feature icons based on AI analysis of the selected image, ensuring users only see applicable options for their specific project context.

## Problem Statement

Users need access to relevant customization options based on their selected image context. Showing all possible options regardless of context creates confusion and inefficiency. For example, displaying kitchen renovation options when working with an exterior garden image would be irrelevant and distracting.

## Solution

An AI-powered system that analyzes uploaded images and dynamically presents only contextually relevant feature icons and their associated configuration panels.

## Core Components

- **Current Style**: Modern, traditional, minimalist, etc.
- **Existing Elements**: Furniture, fixtures, architectural features
- **Lighting Conditions**: Natural, artificial, mixed
- **Scale/Perspective**: Close-up detail vs full room view

- Hide: Residential-specific features

**Empty Space:**
- Show: Full range of applicable options based on interior/exterior detection

### 4. Panel Behavior

#### 4.1 Panel Types
- **Compact**: Initial icon row (3-5 most relevant icons)
- **Expanded**: Sliding panel with filtered options
- **Full Screen**: Detailed configuration interfaces

#### 4.2 Progressive Disclosure
1. Initial state: Show 3-5 most relevant icons
2. User input: Icons update based on text description
3. Swipe/scroll: Reveal additional relevant icons
4. Tap icon: Open contextual panel with filtered content

### 5. AI Context Analysis

#### Input Processing:
1. Image upload triggers immediate analysis
2. Extract key features and classifications
3. Cross-reference with user text input
4. Generate relevance scores for each feature category
5. Display icons sorted by relevance (highest first)

#### Relevance Scoring Factors:
- Image content match: 40%
- User text input: 30%
- Common combinations: 20%
- User history/preferences: 10%

### 6. User Experience Flow

1. **User uploads/selects image**
   - AI analyzes image in background
   - Loading state shows during analysis

2. **Initial icon display**
   - 3-5 most relevant icons appear

3. **User interaction**
   - Text input refines icon selection
   - Icons dynamically update/reorder
   - Smooth transitions between states

4. **Panel interaction**
   - Tap icon: Panel slides up
   - Contextual content pre-filtered
   - Options relevant to image/input only

5. **Selection confirmation**
   - Selected options badge on icon
   - Visual feedback for active selections

## Technical Requirements

### Performance
- Image analysis: < 2 seconds
- Icon update: < 300ms after text input
- Smooth 60fps animations

### Accuracy
