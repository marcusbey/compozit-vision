# Professional Mobile App Strategy for Photo-to-Project Interior Design with AI Integration

## Executive Overview

Building a professional photo-to-project interior design application requires a sophisticated multi-component architecture that combines computer vision, spatial measurement, AI processing, and furniture database management. This comprehensive strategy addresses your key requirements for space dimension evaluation, depth analysis, and AI-powered furniture matching.

## Core Technology Architecture

### **Space Dimension and Depth Estimation System**

The foundation of your app requires advanced computer vision capabilities for accurate spatial measurement from photos[1][2]. Modern mobile devices offer several approaches:

**ARKit RoomPlan (iOS)** provides the most professional solution for LiDAR-enabled devices, offering real-time 3D room scanning with semantic understanding of walls, windows, doors, and furniture[3][4][5]. This API generates parametric 3D models with precise dimensions and can detect room-defining objects automatically.

**Monocular Depth Estimation** serves as the universal fallback for devices without LiDAR[6][7][8]. State-of-the-art models like MiDaS, Depth-Anything, and LiteDepth can achieve real-time performance on mobile devices while maintaining accuracy[9][10]. These models analyze single images to generate depth maps, enabling dimension calculation through reference objects or user calibration.

**Hybrid AR Measurement Systems** combine multiple approaches[2][11][12]. Apps like AR Plan 3D demonstrate successful implementation of room scanning that works across different device capabilities, providing measurement accuracy suitable for professional applications.

### **AI Model Integration: Google's Nano Banana (Gemini 2.5 Flash)**

Google's recently revealed "Nano Banana" model, now officially known as **Gemini 2.5 Flash Image**, represents cutting-edge AI for image editing and transformation[13][14][15][16]. This model excels at:

- **Natural Language Image Editing** - Users can describe desired changes in plain language
- **High Consistency Rates** - Maintains 90-95% consistency across edits while preserving original characteristics
- **One-Shot Accuracy** - Delivers precise results without multiple iterations
- **Real-time Processing** - Optimized for mobile deployment through Gemini API

**Integration Strategy:**
1. **Cloud API Integration** - Access through Gemini API for maximum model capabilities[15][16]
2. **On-Device Processing** - Utilize compressed versions for basic transformations when available[17]
3. **Hybrid Architecture** - Combine cloud power for complex transformations with local processing for real-time preview

## Professional Implementation Strategy

### **Phase 1: Core Measurement Infrastructure**

**iOS Development** leverages RoomPlan API for professional-grade room scanning[3][4][18]. Implement the RoomCaptureView with custom coaching UI to guide users through optimal scanning procedures. The system should automatically detect scan quality issues and provide real-time feedback for lighting, distance, and scanning speed[5].

**Android Development** requires custom implementation using ARCore for AR capabilities combined with monocular depth estimation models[19][10]. Integrate established models like LiteDepth or MiDaS through TensorFlow Lite for on-device processing[9][8].

**Cross-Platform Considerations** suggest developing separate native implementations to leverage each platform's strengths, then unifying the backend processing pipeline[20][21].

### **Phase 2: Furniture Database and Matching System**

**Database Architecture** requires comprehensive furniture categorization with multiple filtering dimensions[22][23][24]:
- **Size Classifications** - Precise dimensional data for compatibility checking
