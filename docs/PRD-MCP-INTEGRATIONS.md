```typescript
export class MCPManager {
  private servers: Map<string, MCPServer> = new Map();
  private loadBalancer: LoadBalancer;
  private circuitBreaker: CircuitBreaker;
  private rateLimiter: RateLimiter;
  
  async initializeServers(config: MCPConfig[]): Promise<void> {
    for (const serverConfig of config) {
      const server = new MCPServer(serverConfig);
      await server.connect();
      this.servers.set(serverConfig.name, server);
    }
  }
  
  async executeRequest<T>(
    serverName: string, 
    operation: string, 
    params: any
  ): Promise<T> {
    await this.rateLimiter.checkLimit(serverName);
    const server = this.servers.get(serverName);
    
    if (!server || this.circuitBreaker.isOpen(serverName)) {
      throw new Error(`Server ${serverName} unavailable`);
    }
    
    try {
