# New User Journey - One Screen Experience

## Overview

The **One Screen Experience** represents a paradigm shift from traditional multi-step wizards to a unified, contextual interface that keeps users focused on their design transformation. This approach eliminates navigation confusion and maintains visual continuity throughout the entire AI-powered interior design process.

## Core UX Philosophy

**Visual Continuity + Contextual Interactions = Seamless Experience**

- User's photo remains the focal point throughout the entire journey
- All interactions happen through contextual sliding panels
- No page transitions or navigation complexity
- AI-driven suggestions based on visual context

## The UnifiedProjectScreen Architecture
