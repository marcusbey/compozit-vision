# ðŸ”§ Database Schema Fix Instructions

## Problem
The error shows that the `public.user_reference_images` table doesn't exist in your Supabase database, which is causing the reference images feature to fail.

## Solution
You need to create the missing database tables by running the provided SQL schema.

## Step-by-Step Fix

### 1. Access Supabase Dashboard
1. Go to [Supabase Dashboard](https://supabase.com/dashboard)
2. Select your project
3. Navigate to **SQL Editor** in the left sidebar

### 2. Run Database Schema
1. Copy the entire contents of this file: `scripts/create-reference-system-tables-fixed.sql`
2. Paste it into the SQL Editor
3. Click **Run** to execute all the SQL commands

**Note**: Use the `-fixed.sql` version which includes the missing `sort_order` column in the `user_color_palettes` table.

### 3. Verify Tables Created
The following tables should now exist in your database:
- âœ… `project_categories`
- âœ… `user_reference_images`
- âœ… `user_color_palettes` 
- âœ… `reference_usage_history`
- âœ… `ai_processing_jobs`
