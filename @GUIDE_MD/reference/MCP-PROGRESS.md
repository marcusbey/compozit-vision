## Phase 3: Service Layer Implementation (Completed ‚úÖ)

### Core Services Created
- [x] **Authentication Service** - Complete Supabase Auth integration
- [x] **Stripe Service** - Payment processing and subscription management  
- [x] **Supabase Service** - Database operations and real-time subscriptions
- [x] **Credit System** - Consumption tracking and top-up functionality
