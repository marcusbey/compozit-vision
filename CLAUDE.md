## Development Insights

- Need to refactor @mobile/src/screens/04-project-wizard/CategorySelectionScreen.tsx to reduce file length
- Define a clear, step-by-step user journey including:
  * Profile page structure
  * Settings page flow
- Establish a consistent development structure to guide project progression
- Implement a code standard to limit file length to a maximum of 400 lines for improved readability and maintainability
- The 400 lines rule does not apply to 'style' sections
